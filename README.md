# Safer Mains (Home Electricity) Detection
How to detect the presence of mains electricity (in your home) using a RasPi or Arduino

So I really want a SAFE way to detect mains in my workshop so can check whether I have left the lights, or more importantly, the heater on. Apart from the cost there is the fire risk too.

This method is a NO CONTACT method using just a handful of discrete components and costing a couple of pounds (or dollars), if that much!

It's easy to build on strip-board and runs from 3.3 volts to 5-volts. Actually you can power this with 9v if you want, it will still work.

This is what gave me the inspiration:

Assortment of transistors like the ones I use here (2pence or US 3c each!)

Just watch as you open the lid so they don't all get mixed up (don't ask, no, really, don't)  

The sketch I used is simplicity itself but does demonstrate the use of a boolean variable to keep track of the last state.  
It's in the GitHub.
